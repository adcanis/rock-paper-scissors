A project made for The Odin Project's Foundations course. This was also one of the first run-ins with JavaScript and one of my first implementations of FontAwesome icons. 

This project had me scratching my head as mentioned it was one of the first run-ins with JavaScript but also using the 'If' method. 

**What I learned**

- How to use the 'If' method to create results based on selection. 
- How to use the querySelector to recieve information from a specific item
- How to create a random item with the Math.random() function
- How to add eventListeners on click items

You can view the project here
